      Biography
    </h2>
  </div>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, India. He became one of the most respected spiritual and political leaders of 
    the 1900's. Gandhi helped free the Indian people from British rule through nonviolent resistance, and is honoured by Indians as the father of the Indian Nation. 
    He was highly influenced by Thoreau, Tolstoy, Ruskin, and above all the life of Jesus Christ. The Bible, precisely the Sermon of the Mount and the Bagavad -Gita 
    had a great influence on him. The Indian people called Gandhi 'Mahatma', meaning Great Soul. At the age of 13 Gandhi married Kasturba, a girl the same age. Their 
    parents arranged the marriage. The Gandhis had four children. Gandhi studied law in London and returned to India in 1891 to practice. In 1893 he took on a one-yearcontract to do legal work in South Africa.
    <br>Gandhi changed the world in many ways. One way was he won over India's independence from the British. Gandhi won independence for 
    India by using his non-violent methods. He showed the world that using violence was wrong. India loves Gandhi for giving
    them their freedom and independence. One more thing that Gandhi did was tell everyone to stand up for their own rights and to also
    to fight against cruelty. Later on Martin Luther King Jr. used Gandhi's non-violent methods and he won civil rights
    for African Americans. Using non-violence may be the best way to fight! </p>
